# popclipext-awsresource

[PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) appears when you select text with your mouse on your Mac. With this extension, any selected text will be matched against the following AWS resources id patterns to open resource details in the corresponding AWS console dashboard:
- Amazon Machine Images `ami-*`
- Elastic Network Interfaces `eni-*`
- Security Groups `sg-*`
- Elastic Block Store snapshots `snap-*`
- Elastic Block Store volumes `vol-*`
- Virtual Private Clouds `vpc-*`
- Subnets `subnet-*`
- Elastic Compute Cloud instances `i-*`
- IPv4 addresses

When installing the extension you will be asked to select the AWS region to be used when calculating the dashboard links. Of course you must have logged in to the AWS console before to allow this extension to open any of your account dashboards.

Any page is opened using your default browser. However, a new version is in progress allowing you to select an alternative browser. Stay tuned...
